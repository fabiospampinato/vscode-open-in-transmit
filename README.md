Adds a few commands for opening the current file or project in [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit).

This extension will automatically switch to "Local Browser" for you, in order for this to work you might need to grant Visual Studio Code accessibility permissions (System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility).

## Install

Follow the instructions in the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-open-in-transmit), or run the following in the command palette:

```shell
ext install fabiospampinato.vscode-open-in-transmit
```

## Usage

It adds 4 commands to the command palette:

```js

'Open in Transmit (Right)' // Open the current file or project in Transmit's right panel
'Open Root in Transmit (Left)' // Open the current project in Transmit's left panel
